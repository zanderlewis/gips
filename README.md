## What is GIPS?
GIPS is a modern and open source alternative to PrimeNet, the software that powers the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). GIPS is designed to be more user-friendly, more efficient, and more secure than PrimeNet.

## Features
- **Modern UI**: GIPS has a modern and responsive user interface that is easy to use and looks great on any device.
- **Secure**: GIPS uses email verification and two-factor authentication alongside password hashing to keep your account secure.
- **Open Source**: GIPS is open source, so you can see exactly how it works and contribute to its development.
